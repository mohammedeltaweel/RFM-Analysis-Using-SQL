# RFM-Analystis-Using-PostgreSQL
Targeted marketing campaigns are often based on segmenting customers into groups, then targeting the customers who are more likely to respond to the campaign. A classic method to do this is RFM analysis which divide the customers based on three parameters:
1. Recency: What is the last time the customer buy from us?
2. Frequency: How many times did customer buy in specific period?
3. Monetary: How much did customer spend?

RFM can be done using many analytical tools, in this project PostgreSQL analytical window functions where used to do it.
