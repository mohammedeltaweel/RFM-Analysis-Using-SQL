# RFM-Analystis-Using-PostgreSQL
Who are the customer should the company target when launching a new marketing campaign?

RFM analysis can be used to answer this question. This project makes use of SQL analytical functions to conduct RFM analysis. 

Targeted marketing campaigns are often based on segmenting customers into groups, then targeting the customers who are more likely to respond to the campaign. A classic method to do this is RFM analysis which divides the customers based on three parameters:
1. Recency: What is the last time the customer buys from us?
2. Frequency: How many times did the customer buy in a specific period?
3. Monetary: How much did the customer spend?


The project has the following:

  1.Using SQL to clean and discover the data

  2.Using window and analytical functions to tell a data story

  3.Using PostgreSQL to conduct RFM analysis
