# RFM-Analystis-Using-PostgreSQL
Targeted marketing campaigns are often based on segmenting customers into groups, then targeting the customers who are more likely to respond to the campaign. A classic method to do this is RFM analysis which divides the customers based on three parameters:
1. Recency: What is the last time the customer buys from us?
2. Frequency: How many times did the customer buy in a specific period?
3. Monetary: How much did the customer spend?

RFM can be done using many analytical tools. In this project, I've used PostgreSQL analytical window functions to do it.
